# TEST YOUR LUCK


This is a simple game called "test your luck". Built from HTML, CSS, and JS.


You're gonna start from 5, where the odds are 50:50. A number, ranged from 0 to 10, will be randomed and all you have to do is to guess whether that number is lower, equal, or higher than your current number.
If your guess is correct, you'll get 1 point. If your guess is incorrect, you'll lose 1 point, but your score can't be less than 0. After each guess, the randomed number will replace your current number, and you may continue playing. Let's see how far you can go :)


To make this more interesting, i added some special treats :

"HIGH RISK, HIGH REWARD" - if you choose equal and your guess is correct, you will get 10                                  points instead of just 1\s\s
"I WIN THE JACKPOT!" - if you get 100 from the randomed number regardless what your guess is,                          your current score will be multiplied by 2\s\s
"BAD LUCK" - if you get 0 from the randomed number regardless what your guess is, your score                 will reset to 0\s\s

If multiple treats occured, the effect applies according to the order above.
